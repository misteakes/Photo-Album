                        i've always thought that the pictures people take says a lot about the person. i've also noticed that i have more pictures than the average person, but it only becomes a problem when i'm running out of storage :'-)

                        i was inspired by a site i made last semester. it showed my instagram pictures, organized by year from 2016 to 2018. i wanted to create something like that, but with the pictures from 2019!

                        i hope you liked seeing what i have inside my phone from all the food i eat to the things i screenshot from reddit!
